//! Full 3-D orbital mechanics: classical orbital elements and a
//! two-body + J2 propagator.
//!
//! Where [`crate::orbit`] handles the *planar* ascent state, this module
//! works in the full three-dimensional Earth-centred inertial (ECI)
//! frame and carries the complete set of **classical orbital elements**
//! (COE): semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right-ascension of
//! the ascending node (RAAN), argument of periapsis and true anomaly.
//!
//! It provides exact state ↔ element conversions (round-trip stable) and
//! an RK4 propagator with optional **J2 oblateness** — the dominant
//! perturbation in low Earth orbit, which makes the node regress and the
//! line of apsides rotate. The J2 secular rates are also given in closed
//! form so the propagator can be validated against them.
//!
//! Scope: this is the point-mass orbital layer (Phase 1 of the
//! launch-vehicle roadmap). It is not a full force model — no drag,
//! third-body, SRP, or higher-order geopotential yet — but J2 alone
//! captures the first-order LEO secular behaviour to good accuracy.
